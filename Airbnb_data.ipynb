Not that this would be particularly unreasonable but it made us feel like we were walking on egg shells in and around the house. \\n\\nThe hosts were aware that we were a group of six yet one of the beds was not prepared and we ran out of toilet paper well before we were due to check out despite only being there 2 nights.
